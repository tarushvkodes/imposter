# Imposter

A word guessing party game you can play in groups. One player is secretly the **imposter** with a slightly different word — can the group figure out who it is?

## How to Play

1. **Setup** — Choose the number of players (3–20) and enter everyone's name.
2. **Word Reveal** — Pass the device around. Each player privately sees their word and the category. One player is the imposter and gets a similar but different word.
3. **Discussion** — Players take turns giving a one-word clue about their word. The goal is to prove you know the real word without giving it away to the imposter.
4. **Vote** — Everyone votes on who they think the imposter is.
5. **Results** — If the group correctly identifies the imposter, they win! Otherwise the imposter wins.
